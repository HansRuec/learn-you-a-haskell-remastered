<h2 id="about-this-tutorial">About this tutorial</h2>
<p>Welcome to <em>Learn You a Haskell for Great Good</em>! If you&apos;re reading this,
chances are you want to learn Haskell. Well, you&apos;ve come to the right
place, but let&apos;s talk about this tutorial a bit first.</p>
<p>I decided to write this because I wanted to solidify my own knowledge of
Haskell and because I thought I could help people new to Haskell learn
it from my perspective. There are quite a few tutorials on Haskell
floating around on the internet. When I was starting out in Haskell, I
didn&apos;t learn from just one resource. The way I learned it was by reading
several different tutorials and articles because each explained
something in a different way than the other did. By going through
several resources, I was able put together the pieces and it all just
came falling into place. So this is an attempt at adding another useful
resource for learning Haskell so you have a bigger chance of finding one
you like.</p>
<p><img src="img/bird.png" alt="bird"></p>
<p>This tutorial is aimed at people who have experience in imperative
programming languages (C, C++, Java, Python …) but haven&apos;t programmed in
a functional language before (Haskell, ML, OCaml …). Although I bet that
even if you don&apos;t have any significant programming experience, a smart
person such as yourself will be able to follow along and learn Haskell.</p>
<p>The channel #haskell on the freenode network is a great place to ask
questions if you&apos;re feeling stuck. People there are extremely nice,
patient and understanding to newbies.</p>
<p>I failed to learn Haskell approximately 2 times before finally grasping
it because it all just seemed too weird to me and I didn&apos;t get it. But
then once it just &quot;clicked&quot; and after getting over that initial hurdle,
it was pretty much smooth sailing. I guess what I&apos;m trying to say is:
Haskell is great and if you&apos;re interested in programming you should
really learn it even if it seems weird at first. Learning Haskell is
much like learning to program for the first time — it&apos;s fun! It forces
you to think differently, which brings us to the next section …</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-haskell">So what&apos;s Haskell?</h2>
<p><img src="img/fx.png" alt="fx"> Haskell is a <em>purely
functional programming language</em>. In imperative languages you get things
done by giving the computer a sequence of tasks and then it executes
them. While executing them, it can change state. For instance, you set
variable <code>a</code> to 5 and then do some stuff and then set it to something
else. You have control flow structures for doing some action several
times. In purely functional programming you don&apos;t tell the computer what
to do as such but rather you tell it what stuff <em>is</em>. The factorial of a
number is the product of all the numbers from 1 to that number, the sum
of a list of numbers is the first number plus the sum of all the other
numbers, and so on. You express that in the form of functions. You also
can&apos;t set a variable to something and then set it to something else
later. If you say that a is 5, you can&apos;t say it&apos;s something else later
because you just said it was 5. What are you, some kind of liar? So in
purely functional languages, a function has no side-effects. The only
thing a function can do is calculate something and return it as a
result. At first, this seems kind of limiting but it actually has some
very nice consequences: if a function is called twice with the same
parameters, it&apos;s guaranteed to return the same result. That&apos;s called
referential transparency and not only does it allow the compiler to
reason about the program&apos;s behavior, but it also allows you to easily
deduce (and even prove) that a function is correct and then build more
complex functions by gluing simple functions together.</p>
<p><img src="img/lazy.png" alt="lazy"> Haskell is <em>lazy</em>. That
means that unless specifically told otherwise, Haskell won&apos;t execute
functions and calculate things until it&apos;s really forced to show you a
result. That goes well with referential transparency and it allows you
to think of programs as a series of <em>transformations on data</em>. It also
allows cool things such as infinite data structures. Say you have an
immutable list of numbers <code>xs = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]</code> and a function <code>doubleMe</code>
which multiplies every element by 2 and then returns a new list. If we
wanted to multiply our list by 8 in an imperative language and did
<code>doubleMe(doubleMe(doubleMe(xs)))</code>, it would probably pass through the
list once and make a copy and then return it. Then it would pass through
the list another two times and return the result. In a lazy language,
calling <code>doubleMe</code> on a list without forcing it to show you the result
ends up in the program sort of telling you &quot;Yeah yeah, I&apos;ll do it
later!&quot;. But once you want to see the result, the first <code>doubleMe</code> tells
the second one it wants the result, now! The second one says that to the
third one and the third one reluctantly gives back a doubled 1, which is
a 2. The second one receives that and gives back 4 to the first one. The
first one sees that and tells you the first element is 8. So it only
does one pass through the list and only when you really need it. That
way when you want something from a lazy language you can just take some
initial data and efficiently transform and mend it so it resembles what
you want at the end.</p>
<p><img src="img/boat.png" alt="boat"> Haskell is <em>statically
typed</em>. When you compile your program, the compiler knows which piece of
code is a number, which is a string and so on. That means that a lot of
possible errors are caught at compile time. If you try to add together a
number and a string, the compiler will whine at you. Haskell uses a very
good type system that has <em>type inference</em>. That means that you don&apos;t
have to explicitly label every piece of code with a type because the
type system can intelligently figure out a lot about it. If you say <code>a =
5 + 4</code>, you don&apos;t have to tell Haskell that <code>a</code> is a number, it can figure
that out by itself. Type inference also allows your code to be more
general. If a function you make takes two parameters and adds them
together and you don&apos;t explicitly state their type, the function will
work on any two parameters that act like numbers.</p>
<p>Haskell is <em>elegant and concise</em>. Because it uses a lot of high level
concepts, Haskell programs are usually shorter than their imperative
equivalents. And shorter programs are easier to maintain than longer
ones and have less bugs.</p>
<p>Haskell was made by some <em>really smart guys</em> (with PhDs). Work on
Haskell began in 1987 when a committee of researchers got together to
design a kick-ass language. In 2003 the Haskell Report was published,
which defines a stable version of the language.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-dive-in">What you need to dive in</h2>
<p>A text editor and a Haskell compiler. You probably already have your
favorite text editor installed so we won&apos;t waste time on that. For the
purposes of this tutorial we&apos;ll be using GHC, the most widely used
Haskell compiler. The best way to get started is to download the
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Haskell Platform</a>, which is
basically Haskell with batteries included.</p>
<p>GHC can take a Haskell script (they usually have a .hs extension) and
compile it but it also has an interactive mode which allows you to
interactively interact with scripts. Interactively. You can call
functions from scripts that you load and the results are displayed
immediately. For learning it&apos;s a lot easier and faster than compiling
every time you make a change and then running the program from the
prompt. The interactive mode is invoked by typing in <code>ghci</code> at your
prompt. If you have defined some functions in a file called, say,
<code>myfunctions.hs</code>, you load up those functions by typing in <code>:l myfunctions</code>
and then you can play with them, provided <code>myfunctions.hs</code> is in the same
folder from which <code>ghci</code> was invoked. If you change the .hs script, just
run <code>:l myfunctions</code> again or do <code>:r</code>, which is equivalent because it
reloads the current script. The usual workflow for me when playing
around in stuff is defining some functions in a .hs file, loading it up
and messing around with them and then changing the .hs file, loading it
up again and so on. This is also what we&apos;ll be doing here.</p>
