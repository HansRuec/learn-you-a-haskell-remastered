<p><img src="img/recursion.png" alt="SOVIET RUSSIA"></p>
<p>We mention recursion briefly in the previous chapter. In this chapter,
we&apos;ll take a closer look at recursion, why it&apos;s important to Haskell and
how we can work out very concise and elegant solutions to problems by
thinking recursively.</p>
<p>If you still don&apos;t know what recursion is, read this sentence. Haha!
Just kidding! Recursion is actually a way of defining functions in which
the function is applied inside its own definition. Definitions in
mathematics are often given recursively. For instance, the Fibonacci
sequence is defined recursively. First, we define the first two
Fibonacci numbers non-recursively. We say that $F(0) = 0$ and
$F(1) = 1$, meaning that the 0th and 1st Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1,
respectively. Then we say that for any other natural number, that
Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers. So
$F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)$. That way, $F(3)$ is $F(2) + F(1)$, which is
$(F(1) + F(0)) + F(1)$. Because we&apos;ve now come down to only
non-recursively defined Fibonacci numbers, we can safely say that $F(3)$
is 2. Having an element or two in a recursion definition defined
non-recursively (like $F(0)$ and $F(1)$ here) is also called the <em>edge
condition</em> and is important if you want your recursive function to
terminate. If we hadn&apos;t defined $F(0)$ and $F(1)$ non recursively, you&apos;d
never get a solution any number because you&apos;d reach 0 and then you&apos;d go
into negative numbers. All of a sudden, you&apos;d be saying that $F(-2000)$
is $F(-2001) + F(-2002)$ and there still wouldn&apos;t be an end in sight!</p>
<p>Recursion is important to Haskell because unlike imperative languages,
you do computations in Haskell by declaring what something <em>is</em> instead
of declaring <em>how</em> you get it. That&apos;s why there are no while loops or
for loops in Haskell and instead we many times have to use recursion to
declare what something is.</p>
<h2 id="maximum-awesome">Maximum awesome</h2>
<p>The <code>maximum</code> function takes a list of things that can be ordered (e.g.
instances of the <code>Ord</code> typeclass) and returns the biggest of them. Think
about how you&apos;d implement that in an imperative fashion. You&apos;d probably
set up a variable to hold the maximum value so far and then you&apos;d loop
through the elements of a list and if an element is bigger than then the
current maximum value, you&apos;d replace it with that element. The maximum
value that remains at the end is the result. Whew! That&apos;s quite a lot of
words to describe such a simple algorithm!</p>
<p>Now let&apos;s see how we&apos;d define it recursively. We could first set up an
edge condition and say that the maximum of a singleton list is equal to
the only element in it. Then we can say that the maximum of a longer
list is the head if the head is bigger than the maximum of the tail. If
the maximum of the tail is bigger, well, then it&apos;s the maximum of the
tail. That&apos;s it! Now let&apos;s implement that in Haskell.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">maximum&apos;</span> :: (<span class="hljs-type">Ord</span> a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; a
<span class="hljs-title">maximum&apos;</span> [] = error <span class="hljs-string">&quot;maximum of empty list&quot;</span>
<span class="hljs-title">maximum&apos;</span> [x] = x
<span class="hljs-title">maximum&apos;</span> (x:xs)
    | x &gt; maxTail = x
    | otherwise = maxTail
    <span class="hljs-keyword">where</span> maxTail = maximum&apos; xs
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, pattern matching goes great with recursion! Most
imperative languages don&apos;t have pattern matching so you have to make a
lot of if else statements to test for edge conditions. Here, we simply
put them out as patterns. So the first edge condition says that if the
list is empty, crash! Makes sense because what&apos;s the maximum of an empty
list? I don&apos;t know. The second pattern also lays out an edge condition.
It says that if it&apos;s the singleton list, just give back the only
element.</p>
<p>Now the third pattern is where the action happens. We use pattern
matching to split a list into a head and a tail. This is a very common
idiom when doing recursion with lists, so get used to it. We use a
<em>where</em> binding to define <code>maxTail</code> as the maximum of the rest of the
list. Then we check if the head is greater than the maximum of the rest
of the list. If it is, we return the head. Otherwise, we return the
maximum of the rest of the list.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s take an example list of numbers and check out how this would work
on them: <code>[2,5,1]</code>. If we call <code>maximum&apos;</code> on that, the first two patterns
won&apos;t match. The third one will and the list is split into <code>2</code> and <code>[5,1]</code>.
The <em>where</em> clause wants to know the maximum of <code>[5,1]</code>, so we follow that
route. It matches the third pattern again and <code>[5,1]</code> is split into <code>5</code> and
<code>[1]</code>. Again, the <code>where</code> clause wants to know the maximum of <code>[1]</code>. Because
that&apos;s the edge condition, it returns <code>1</code>. Finally! So going up one step,
comparing <code>5</code> to the maximum of <code>[1]</code> (which is <code>1</code>), we obviously get back <code>5</code>.
So now we know that the maximum of <code>[5,1]</code> is <code>5</code>. We go up one step again
where we had <code>2</code> and <code>[5,1]</code>. Comparing <code>2</code> with the maximum of <code>[5,1]</code>, which
is <code>5</code>, we choose <code>5</code>.</p>
<p>An even clearer way to write this function is to use <code>max</code>. If you
remember, <code>max</code> is a function that takes two numbers and returns the
bigger of them. Here&apos;s how we could rewrite <code>maximum&apos;</code> by using <code>max</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">maximum&apos;</span> :: (<span class="hljs-type">Ord</span> a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; a
<span class="hljs-title">maximum&apos;</span> [] = error <span class="hljs-string">&quot;maximum of empty list&quot;</span>
<span class="hljs-title">maximum&apos;</span> [x] = x
<span class="hljs-title">maximum&apos;</span> (x:xs) = max x (maximum&apos; xs)
</code></pre>
<p>How&apos;s that for elegant! In essence, the maximum of a list is the max of
the first element and the maximum of the tail.</p>
<p><img src="img/maxs.png" alt="max"></p>
<h2 id="a-few-more-recursive-functions">A few more recursive functions</h2>
<p>Now that we know how to generally think recursively, let&apos;s implement a
few functions using recursion. First off, we&apos;ll implement <code>replicate</code>.
<code>replicate</code> takes an <code>Int</code> and some element and returns a list that has
several repetitions of the same element. For instance, <code>replicate 3 5</code>
returns <code>[5,5,5]</code>. Let&apos;s think about the edge condition. My guess is that
the edge condition is 0 or less. If we try to replicate something zero
times, it should return an empty list. Also for negative numbers,
because it doesn&apos;t really make sense.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">replicate&apos;</span> :: (<span class="hljs-type">Num</span> i, <span class="hljs-type">Ord</span> i) =&gt; i -&gt; a -&gt; [a]
<span class="hljs-title">replicate&apos;</span> n x
    | n &lt;= <span class="hljs-number">0</span>    = []
    | otherwise = x:replicate&apos; (n<span class="hljs-number">-1</span>) x
</code></pre>
<p>We used guards here instead of patterns because we&apos;re testing for a
boolean condition. If <code>n</code> is less than or equal to 0, return an empty
list. Otherwise return a list that has <code>x</code> as the first element and then <code>x</code>
replicated n-1 times as the tail. Eventually, the <code>(n-1)</code> part will cause
our function to reach the edge condition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note:</em> <code>Num</code> is not a subclass of <code>Ord</code>. That means that what constitutes
for a number doesn&apos;t really have to adhere to an ordering. So that&apos;s why
we have to specify both the <code>Num</code> and <code>Ord</code> class constraints when doing
addition or subtraction and also comparison.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next up, we&apos;ll implement <code>take</code>. It takes a certain number of elements
from a list. For instance, <code>take 3 [5,4,3,2,1]</code> will return <code>[5,4,3]</code>. If we
try to take 0 or less elements from a list, we get an empty list. Also
if we try to take anything from an empty list, we get an empty list.
Notice that those are two edge conditions right there. So let&apos;s write
that out:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">take&apos;</span> :: (<span class="hljs-type">Num</span> i, <span class="hljs-type">Ord</span> i) =&gt; i -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
<span class="hljs-title">take&apos;</span> n _
    | n &lt;= <span class="hljs-number">0</span>   = []
<span class="hljs-title">take&apos;</span> _ []     = []
<span class="hljs-title">take&apos;</span> n (x:xs) = x : take&apos; (n<span class="hljs-number">-1</span>) xs
</code></pre>
<p><img src="img/painter.png" alt="painter"></p>
<p>The first pattern specifies that if we try to take a 0 or negative
number of elements, we get an empty list. Notice that we&apos;re using <code>_</code> to
match the list because we don&apos;t really care what it is in this case.
Also notice that we use a guard, but without an <code>otherwise</code> part. That
means that if <code>n</code> turns out to be more than 0, the matching will fall
through to the next pattern. The second pattern indicates that if we try
to take anything from an empty list, we get an empty list. The third
pattern breaks the list into a head and a tail. And then we state that
taking <code>n</code> elements from a list equals a list that has <code>x</code> as the head and
then a list that takes <code>n-1</code> elements from the tail as a tail. Try using a
piece of paper to write down how the evaluation would look like if we
try to take, say, 3 from <code>[4,3,2,1]</code>.</p>
<p><code>reverse</code> simply reverses a list. Think about the edge condition. What is
it? Come on ... it&apos;s the empty list! An empty list reversed equals the
empty list itself. O-kay. What about the rest of it? Well, you could say
that if we split a list to a head and a tail, the reversed list is equal
to the reversed tail and then the head at the end.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">reverse&apos;</span> :: [a] -&gt; [a]
<span class="hljs-title">reverse&apos;</span> [] = []
<span class="hljs-title">reverse&apos;</span> (x:xs) = reverse&apos; xs ++ [x]
</code></pre>
<p>There we go!</p>
<p>Because Haskell supports infinite lists, our recursion doesn&apos;t really
have to have an edge condition. But if it doesn&apos;t have it, it will
either keep churning at something infinitely or produce an infinite data
structure, like an infinite list. The good thing about infinite lists
though is that we can cut them where we want. <code>repeat</code> takes an element
and returns an infinite list that just has that element. A recursive
implementation of that is really easy, watch.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">repeat&apos;</span> :: a -&gt; [a]
<span class="hljs-title">repeat&apos;</span> x = x:repeat&apos; x
</code></pre>
<p>Calling <code>repeat 3</code> will give us a list that starts with <code>3</code> and then has an
infinite amount of 3&apos;s as a tail. So calling <code>repeat 3</code> would evaluate
like <code>3:repeat 3</code>, which is <code>3:(3:repeat 3)</code>, which is <code>3:(3:(3:repeat 3))</code>,
etc. <code>repeat 3</code> will never finish evaluating, whereas <code>take 5 (repeat 3)</code>
will give us a list of five 3&apos;s. So essentially it&apos;s like doing
<code>replicate 5 3</code>.</p>
<p><code>zip</code> takes two lists and zips them together. <code>zip [1,2,3] [2,3]</code> returns
<code>[(1,2),(2,3)]</code>, because it truncates the longer list to match the length
of the shorter one. How about if we zip something with an empty list?
Well, we get an empty list back then. So there&apos;s our edge condition.
However, <code>zip</code> takes two lists as parameters, so there are actually two
edge conditions.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">zip&apos;</span> :: [a] -&gt; [b] -&gt; [(a,b)]
<span class="hljs-title">zip&apos;</span> _ [] = []
<span class="hljs-title">zip&apos;</span> [] _ = []
<span class="hljs-title">zip&apos;</span> (x:xs) (y:ys) = (x,y):zip&apos; xs ys
</code></pre>
<p>First two patterns say that if the first list or second list is empty,
we get an empty list. The third one says that two lists zipped are equal
to pairing up their heads and then tacking on the zipped tails. Zipping
<code>[1,2,3]</code> and <code>[&apos;a&apos;,&apos;b&apos;]</code> will eventually try to zip <code>[3]</code> with <code>[]</code>. The edge
condition patterns kick in and so the result is <code>(1,&apos;a&apos;):(2,&apos;b&apos;):[]</code>,
which is exactly the same as <code>[(1,&apos;a&apos;),(2,&apos;b&apos;)]</code>.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s implement one more standard library function — <code>elem</code>. It takes an
element and a list and sees if that element is in the list. The edge
condition, as is most of the times with lists, is the empty list. We
know that an empty list contains no elements, so it certainly doesn&apos;t
have the droids we&apos;re looking for.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">elem&apos;</span> :: (<span class="hljs-type">Eq</span> a) =&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; <span class="hljs-type">Bool</span>
<span class="hljs-title">elem&apos;</span> a [] = <span class="hljs-type">False</span>
<span class="hljs-title">elem&apos;</span> a (x:xs)
    | a == x    = <span class="hljs-type">True</span>
    | otherwise = a `elem&apos;` xs
</code></pre>
<p>Pretty simple and expected. If the head isn&apos;t the element then we check
the tail. If we reach an empty list, the result is <code>False</code>.</p>
<h2 id="quick-sort">Quick, sort!</h2>
<p>We have a list of items that can be sorted. Their type is an instance of
the <code>Ord</code> typeclass. And now, we want to sort them! There&apos;s a very cool
algorithm for sorting called quicksort. It&apos;s a very clever way of sorting
items. While it takes upwards of 10 lines to implement quicksort in
imperative languages, the implementation is much shorter and elegant in
Haskell. Quicksort has become a sort of poster child for Haskell.
Therefore, let&apos;s implement it here, even though implementing quicksort
in Haskell is considered really cheesy because everyone does it to
showcase how elegant Haskell is.</p>
<p><img src="img/quickman.png" alt="quickman"></p>
<p>So, the type signature is going to be
<code>quicksort :: (Ord a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]</code>.
No surprises there. The edge condition? Empty list, as is expected.
A sorted empty list is an empty list. Now here comes the main algorithm:
<em>a sorted list is a list that has all the values smaller than (or equal
to) the head of the list in front (and those values are sorted), then
comes the head of the list in the middle and then come all the values
that are bigger than the head (they&apos;re also sorted).</em> Notice that we
said <em>sorted</em> two times in this definition, so we&apos;ll probably have to
make the recursive call twice! Also notice that we defined it using the
verb <em>is</em> to define the algorithm instead of saying <em>do this, do that,
then do that ...</em>. That&apos;s the beauty of functional programming! How are
we going to filter the list so that we get only the elements smaller
than the head of our list and only elements that are bigger? List
comprehensions. So, let&apos;s dive in and define this function.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">quicksort</span> :: (<span class="hljs-type">Ord</span> a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
<span class="hljs-title">quicksort</span> [] = []
<span class="hljs-title">quicksort</span> (x:xs) =
    <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> smallerSorted = quicksort [a | a &lt;- xs, a &lt;= x]
        biggerSorted = quicksort [a | a &lt;- xs, a &gt; x]
    <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>  smallerSorted ++ [x] ++ biggerSorted
</code></pre>
<p>Let&apos;s give it a small test run to see if it appears to behave correctly.</p>
<p><del>~~ {.haskell:ghci name=&quot;code&quot;}
ghci&gt; quicksort [10,2,5,3,1,6,7,4,2,3,4,8,9]
[1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
ghci&gt; quicksort &quot;the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&quot;
&quot;        abcdeeefghhijklmnoooopqrrsttuuvwxyz&quot;
~</del>~</p>
<p>Booyah! That&apos;s what I&apos;m talking about! So if we have, say
<code>[5,1,9,4,6,7,3]</code> and we want to sort it, this algorithm will first take
the head, which is <code>5</code> and then put it in the middle of two lists that are
smaller and bigger than it. So at one point, you&apos;ll have
<code>[1,4,3] ++ [5] ++ [9,6,7]</code>. We know that once the list is sorted completely,
the number <code>5</code> will stay in the fourth place since there are 3 numbers lower
than it and 3 numbers higher than it. Now, if we sort <code>[1,4,3]</code> and <code>[9,6,7]</code>, we
have a sorted list! We sort the two lists using the same function.
Eventually, we&apos;ll break it up so much that we reach empty lists and an
empty list is already sorted in a way, by virtue of being empty. Here&apos;s
an illustration:</p>
<p><img src="img/quicksort.png" alt="quicksort"></p>
<p>An element that is in place and won&apos;t move anymore is represented in
orange. If you read them from left to right, you&apos;ll see the sorted list.
Although we chose to compare all the elements to the heads, we could
have used any element to compare against. In quicksort, an element that
you compare against is called a pivot. They&apos;re in green here. We chose
the head because it&apos;s easy to get by pattern matching. The elements that
are smaller than the pivot are light green and elements larger than the
pivot are dark green. The yellowish gradient thing represents an
application of quicksort.</p>
<h2 id="thinking-recursively">Thinking recursively</h2>
<p>We did quite a bit of recursion so far and as you&apos;ve probably noticed,
there&apos;s a pattern here. Usually you define an edge case and then you
define a function that does something between some element and the
function applied to the rest. It doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;s a list, a tree
or any other data structure. A sum is the first element of a list plus
the sum of the rest of the list. A product of a list is the first
element of the list times the product of the rest of the list. The
length of a list is one plus the length of the tail of the list.
Ekcetera, ekcetera ...</p>
<p><img src="img/brain.png" alt="brain"></p>
<p>Of course, these also have edge cases. Usually the edge case is some
scenario where a recursive application doesn&apos;t make sense. When dealing
with lists, the edge case is most often the empty list. If you&apos;re
dealing with trees, the edge case is usually a node that doesn&apos;t have
any children.</p>
<p>It&apos;s similar when you&apos;re dealing with numbers recursively. Usually it
has to do with some number and the function applied to that number
modified. We did the factorial function earlier and it&apos;s the product of
a number and the factorial of that number minus one. Such a recursive
application doesn&apos;t make sense with zero, because factorials are defined
only for positive integers. Often the edge case value turns out to be an
identity. The identity for multiplication is 1 because if you multiply
something by 1, you get that something back. Also when doing sums of
lists, we define the sum of an empty list as 0 and 0 is the identity for
addition. In quicksort, the edge case is the empty list and the identity
is also the empty list, because if you add an empty list to a list, you
just get the original list back.</p>
<p>So when trying to think of a recursive way to solve a problem, try to
think of when a recursive solution doesn&apos;t apply and see if you can use
that as an edge case, think about identities and think about whether
you&apos;ll break apart the parameters of the function (for instance, lists
are usually broken into a head and a tail via pattern matching) and on
which part you&apos;ll use the recursive call.</p>
