# Introduction

This book is a remastered version of Learn you a Haskell. I just wanted to make it in a new format for learning haskell. I will slowly turn this book into a different one where there are more examples and source code from Real World Haskell as well as Haskell From First Principles.


Just like Rust, we want nice things too.
