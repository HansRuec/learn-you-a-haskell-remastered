<h2 id="pattern-matching">Pattern matching</h2>
<p><img src="img/pattern.png" alt="four!"></p>
<p>This chapter will cover some of Haskell&apos;s cool syntactic constructs and
we&apos;ll start with pattern matching. Pattern matching consists of
specifying patterns to which some data should conform and then checking
to see if it does and deconstructing the data according to those
patterns.</p>
<p>When defining functions, you can define separate function bodies for
different patterns. This leads to really neat code that&apos;s simple and
readable. You can pattern match on any data type — numbers, characters,
lists, tuples, etc. Let&apos;s make a really trivial function that checks if
the number we supplied to it is a seven or not.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">lucky</span> :: (<span class="hljs-type">Integral</span> a) =&gt; a -&gt; <span class="hljs-type">String</span>
<span class="hljs-title">lucky</span> <span class="hljs-number">7</span> = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;LUCKY NUMBER SEVEN!&quot;</span>
<span class="hljs-title">lucky</span> x = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Sorry, you&apos;re out of luck, pal!&quot;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When you call <code>lucky</code>, the patterns will be checked from top to bottom and
when it conforms to a pattern, the corresponding function body will be
used. The only way a number can conform to the first pattern here is if
it is 7. If it&apos;s not, it falls through to the second pattern, which
matches anything and binds it to <code>x</code>. This function could have also been
implemented by using an if statement. But what if we wanted a function
that says the numbers from 1 to 5 and says <code>&quot;Not between 1 and 5&quot;</code> for any
other number? Without pattern matching, we&apos;d have to make a pretty
convoluted if then else tree. However, with it:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">sayMe</span> :: (<span class="hljs-type">Integral</span> a) =&gt; a -&gt; <span class="hljs-type">String</span>
<span class="hljs-title">sayMe</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span> = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;One!&quot;</span>
<span class="hljs-title">sayMe</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span> = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Two!&quot;</span>
<span class="hljs-title">sayMe</span> <span class="hljs-number">3</span> = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Three!&quot;</span>
<span class="hljs-title">sayMe</span> <span class="hljs-number">4</span> = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Four!&quot;</span>
<span class="hljs-title">sayMe</span> <span class="hljs-number">5</span> = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Five!&quot;</span>
<span class="hljs-title">sayMe</span> x = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Not between 1 and 5&quot;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Note that if we moved the last pattern (the catch-all one) to the top,
it would always say <code>&quot;Not between 1 and 5&quot;</code>, because it would catch all
the numbers and they wouldn&apos;t have a chance to fall through and be
checked for any other patterns.</p>
<p>Remember the factorial function we implemented previously? We defined
the factorial of a number <code>n</code> as <code>product [1..n]</code>. We can also define a
factorial function <em>recursively</em>, the way it is usually defined in
mathematics. We start by saying that the factorial of 0 is 1. Then we
state that the factorial of any positive integer is that integer
multiplied by the factorial of its predecessor. Here&apos;s how that looks
like translated in Haskell terms.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">factorial</span> :: (<span class="hljs-type">Integral</span> a) =&gt; a -&gt; a
<span class="hljs-title">factorial</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span> = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
<span class="hljs-title">factorial</span> n = n * factorial (n - <span class="hljs-number">1</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>This is the first time we&apos;ve defined a function recursively. Recursion
is important in Haskell and we&apos;ll take a closer look at it later. But in
a nutshell, this is what happens if we try to get the factorial of, say,</p>
<ol>
<li>It tries to compute <code>3 * factorial 2</code>. The factorial of 2 is
<code>2 * factorial 1</code>, so for now we have <code>3 * (2 * factorial 1)</code>.
<code>factorial 1</code> is <code>1 * factorial 0</code>, so we have
<code>3 * (2 * (1 * factorial 0))</code>. Now here comes the trick — we&apos;ve defined
the factorial of 0 to be just 1 and
because it encounters that pattern before the catch-all one, it just
returns 1. So the final result is equivalent to <code>3 * (2 * (1 * 1))</code>.
Had we written the second pattern on top of the first one, it would
catch all numbers, including 0 and our calculation would never
terminate. That&apos;s why order is important when specifying patterns and
it&apos;s always best to specify the most specific ones first and then the
more general ones later.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pattern matching can also fail. If we define a function like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">charName</span> :: <span class="hljs-type">Char</span> -&gt; <span class="hljs-type">String</span>
<span class="hljs-title">charName</span> &apos;a&apos; = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Albert&quot;</span>
<span class="hljs-title">charName</span> &apos;b&apos; = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Broseph&quot;</span>
<span class="hljs-title">charName</span> &apos;c&apos; = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Cecil&quot;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>and then try to call it with an input that we didn&apos;t expect, this is
what happens:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell">ghci&gt; charName &apos;a&apos;
&quot;Albert&quot;
ghci&gt; charName &apos;b&apos;
&quot;Broseph&quot;
ghci&gt; charName &apos;h&apos;
&quot;*** Exception: tut.hs:(53,0)-(55,21): Non-exhaustive patterns in function charName
</code></pre>
<p>It complains that we have non-exhaustive patterns, and rightfully so.
When making patterns, we should always include a catch-all pattern so
that our program doesn&apos;t crash if we get some unexpected input.</p>
<p>Pattern matching can also be used on tuples. What if we wanted to make a
function that takes two vectors in a 2D space (that are in the form of
pairs) and adds them together? To add together two vectors, we add their
x components separately and then their y components separately. Here&apos;s
how we would have done it if we didn&apos;t know about pattern matching:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">addVectors</span> :: (<span class="hljs-type">Num</span> a) =&gt; (a, a) -&gt; (a, a) -&gt; (a, a)
<span class="hljs-title">addVectors</span> a b = (fst a + fst b, snd a + snd b)
</code></pre>
<p>Well, that works, but there&apos;s a better way to do it. Let&apos;s modify the
function so that it uses pattern matching.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">addVectors</span> :: (<span class="hljs-type">Num</span> a) =&gt; (a, a) -&gt; (a, a) -&gt; (a, a)
<span class="hljs-title">addVectors</span> (x1, y1) (x2, y2) = (x1 + x2, y1 + y2)
</code></pre>
<p>There we go! Much better. Note that this is already a catch-all pattern.
The type of <code>addVectors</code> (in both cases) is
<code>addVectors :: (Num a) =&gt; (a, a) -&gt; (a, a) -&gt; (a, a)</code>,
so we are guaranteed to get two pairs as
parameters.</p>
<p><code>fst</code> and <code>snd</code> extract the components of pairs. But what about triples?
Well, there are no provided functions that do that but we can make our
own.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">first</span> :: (a, b, c) -&gt; a
<span class="hljs-title">first</span> (x, _, _) = x

<span class="hljs-title">second</span> :: (a, b, c) -&gt; b
<span class="hljs-title">second</span> (_, y, _) = y

<span class="hljs-title">third</span> :: (a, b, c) -&gt; c
<span class="hljs-title">third</span> (_, _, z) = z
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>_</code> means the same thing as it does in list comprehensions. It means
that we really don&apos;t care what that part is, so we just write a <code>_</code>.</p>
<p>Which reminds me, you can also pattern match in list comprehensions.
Check this out:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">ghci</span>&gt; <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> xs = [(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>), (<span class="hljs-number">4</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>), (<span class="hljs-number">2</span>,<span class="hljs-number">4</span>), (<span class="hljs-number">5</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>), (<span class="hljs-number">5</span>,<span class="hljs-number">6</span>), (<span class="hljs-number">3</span>,<span class="hljs-number">1</span>)]
<span class="hljs-title">ghci</span>&gt; [a+b | (a,b) &lt;- xs]
[<span class="hljs-number">4</span>,<span class="hljs-number">7</span>,<span class="hljs-number">6</span>,<span class="hljs-number">8</span>,<span class="hljs-number">11</span>,<span class="hljs-number">4</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Should a pattern match fail, it will just move on to the next element.</p>
<p>Lists themselves can also be used in pattern matching. You can match
with the empty list <code>[]</code> or any pattern that involves <code>:</code> and the empty
list. But since <code>[1,2,3]</code> is just syntactic sugar for <code>1:2:3:[]</code>, you can
also use the former pattern. A pattern like <code>x:xs</code> will bind the head of
the list to <code>x</code> and the rest of it to <code>xs</code>, even if there&apos;s only one element
so <code>xs</code> ends up being an empty list.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note</em>: The <code>x:xs</code> pattern is used a lot, especially with recursive
functions. But patterns that have <code>:</code> in them only match against lists of
length 1 or more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to bind, say, the first three elements to variables and the
rest of the list to another variable, you can use something like
<code>x:y:z:zs</code>. It will only match against lists that have three elements or
more.</p>
<p>Now that we know how to pattern match against list, let&apos;s make our own
implementation of the <code>head</code> function.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">head&apos;</span> :: [a] -&gt; a
<span class="hljs-title">head&apos;</span> [] = error <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Can&apos;t call head on an empty list, dummy!&quot;</span>
<span class="hljs-title">head&apos;</span> (x:_) = x
</code></pre>
<p>Checking if it works:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">ghci</span>&gt; head&apos; [<span class="hljs-number">4</span>,<span class="hljs-number">5</span>,<span class="hljs-number">6</span>]
<span class="hljs-number">4</span>
<span class="hljs-title">ghci</span>&gt; head&apos; <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Hello&quot;</span>
&apos;<span class="hljs-type">H&apos;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Nice! Notice that if you want to bind to several variables (even if one
of them is just <code>_</code> and doesn&apos;t actually bind at all), we have to
surround them in parentheses. Also notice the <code>error</code> function that we
used. It takes a string and generates a runtime error, using that string
as information about what kind of error occurred. It causes the program
to crash, so it&apos;s not good to use it too much. But calling <code>head</code> on an
empty list doesn&apos;t make sense.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s make a trivial function that tells us some of the first elements
of the list in (in)convenient English form.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">tell</span> :: (<span class="hljs-type">Show</span> a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; <span class="hljs-type">String</span>
<span class="hljs-title">tell</span> [] = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;The list is empty&quot;</span>
<span class="hljs-title">tell</span> (x:[]) = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;The list has one element: &quot;</span> ++ show x
<span class="hljs-title">tell</span> (x:y:[]) = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;The list has two elements: &quot;</span> ++ show x ++ <span class="hljs-string">&quot; and &quot;</span> ++ show y
<span class="hljs-title">tell</span> (x:y:_) = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;This list is long. The first two elements are: &quot;</span> ++ show x ++ <span class="hljs-string">&quot; and &quot;</span> ++ show y
</code></pre>
<p>This function is safe because it takes care of the empty list, a
singleton list, a list with two elements and a list with more than two
elements. Note that <code>(x:[])</code> and <code>(x:y:[])</code> could be rewritten as <code>[x]</code> and
<code>[x,y]</code> (because its syntactic sugar, we don&apos;t need the parentheses). We
can&apos;t rewrite <code>(x:y:_)</code> with square brackets because it matches any list
of length 2 or more.</p>
<p>We already implemented our own <code>length</code> function using list comprehension.
Now we&apos;ll do it by using pattern matching and a little recursion:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">length&apos;</span> :: (<span class="hljs-type">Num</span> b) =&gt; [a] -&gt; b
<span class="hljs-title">length&apos;</span> [] = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>
<span class="hljs-title">length&apos;</span> (_:xs) = <span class="hljs-number">1</span> + length&apos; xs
</code></pre>
<p>This is similar to the factorial function we wrote earlier. First we
defined the result of a known input — the empty list. This is also known
as the edge condition. Then in the second pattern we take the list apart
by splitting it into a head and a tail. We say that the length is equal
to 1 plus the length of the tail. We use <code>_</code> to match the head because we
don&apos;t actually care what it is. Also note that we&apos;ve taken care of all
possible patterns of a list. The first pattern matches an empty list and
the second one matches anything that isn&apos;t an empty list.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s see what happens if we call <code>length&apos;</code> on <code>&quot;ham&quot;</code>. First, it will check
if it&apos;s an empty list. Because it isn&apos;t, it falls through to the second
pattern. It matches on the second pattern and there it says that the
length is <code>1 + length&apos; &quot;am&quot;</code>, because we broke it into a head and a tail
and discarded the head. O-kay. The <code>length&apos;</code> of <code>&quot;am&quot;</code> is, similarly,
<code>1 + length&apos; &quot;m&quot;</code>.
So right now we have <code>1 + (1 + length&apos; &quot;m&quot;)</code>. <code>length&apos; &quot;m&quot;</code> is
<code>1 + length&apos; &quot;&quot;</code> (could also be written as <code>1 + length&apos; []</code>). And we&apos;ve
defined <code>length&apos; []</code> to be <code>0</code>. So in the end we have <code>1 + (1 + (1 + 0))</code>.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s implement <code>sum</code>. We know that the sum of an empty list is 0. We
write that down as a pattern. And we also know that the sum of a list is
the head plus the sum of the rest of the list. So if we write that down,
we get:</p>
<p>~~~~ {.haskell:nogutter:nocontrols:hs name=&quot;code&quot;}
sum&apos; :: (Num a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; a
sum&apos; [] = 0
sum&apos; (x:xs) = x + sum&apos; xs</p>
<pre><code>
There&apos;s also a thing called *as patterns*. Those are a handy way of
breaking something up according to a pattern and binding it to names
whilst still keeping a reference to the whole thing. You do that by
putting a name and an `@` in front of a pattern. For instance, the pattern
`xs@(x:y:ys)`. This pattern will match exactly the same thing as `x:y:ys`
but you can easily get the whole list via `xs` instead of repeating
yourself by typing out `x:y:ys` in the function body again. Here&apos;s a quick
and dirty example:

~~~~ {.haskell:nogutter:nocontrols:hs name=&quot;code&quot;}
capital :: String -&gt; String
capital &quot;&quot; = &quot;Empty string, whoops!&quot;
capital all@(x:xs) = &quot;The first letter of &quot; ++ all ++ &quot; is &quot; ++ [x]
</code></pre><p>~~~~ {.haskell:ghci name=&quot;code&quot;}
ghci&gt; capital &quot;Dracula&quot;
&quot;The first letter of Dracula is D&quot;</p>
<pre><code>
Normally we use as patterns to avoid repeating ourselves when matching
against a bigger pattern when we have to use the whole thing again in
the function body.

One more thing — you can&apos;t use `++` in pattern matches. If you tried to
pattern match against `(xs ++ ys)`, what would be in the first and what
would be in the second list? It doesn&apos;t make much sense. It would make
sense to match stuff against `(xs ++ [x,y,z])` or just `(xs ++ [x])`, but
because of the nature of lists, you can&apos;t do that.

&lt;a name=&quot;guards-guards&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Guards, guards!
---------------

![guards](img/guards.png)

Whereas patterns are a way of making sure a value conforms to some form
and deconstructing it, guards are a way of testing whether some property
of a value (or several of them) are true or false. That sounds a lot
like an if statement and it&apos;s very similar. The thing is that guards are
a lot more readable when you have several conditions and they play
really nicely with patterns.

Instead of explaining their syntax, let&apos;s just dive in and make a
function using guards. We&apos;re going to make a simple function that
berates you differently depending on your
[BMI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index) (body mass index).
Your BMI equals your weight divided by your height squared. If your BMI
is less than 18.5, you&apos;re considered underweight. If it&apos;s anywhere from
18.5 to 25 then you&apos;re considered normal. 25 to 30 is overweight and
more than 30 is obese. So here&apos;s the function (we won&apos;t be calculating
it right now, this function just gets a BMI and tells you off)

~~~~ {.haskell:hs name=&quot;code&quot;}
bmiTell :: (RealFloat a) =&gt; a -&gt; String
bmiTell bmi
    | bmi &lt;= 18.5 = &quot;You&apos;re underweight, you emo, you!&quot;
    | bmi &lt;= 25.0 = &quot;You&apos;re supposedly normal. Pffft, I bet you&apos;re ugly!&quot;
    | bmi &lt;= 30.0 = &quot;You&apos;re fat! Lose some weight, fatty!&quot;
    | otherwise   = &quot;You&apos;re a whale, congratulations!&quot;
</code></pre><p>Guards are indicated by pipes that follow a function&apos;s name and its
parameters. Usually, they&apos;re indented a bit to the right and lined up. A
guard is basically a boolean expression. If it evaluates to <code>True</code>, then
the corresponding function body is used. If it evaluates to <code>False</code>,
checking drops through to the next guard and so on. If we call this
function with <code>24.3</code>, it will first check if that&apos;s smaller than or equal
to <code>18.5</code>. Because it isn&apos;t, it falls through to the next guard. The check
is carried out with the second guard and because 24.3 is less than 25.0,
the second string is returned.</p>
<p>This is very reminiscent of a big if else tree in imperative languages,
only this is far better and more readable. While big if else trees are
usually frowned upon, sometimes a problem is defined in such a discrete
way that you can&apos;t get around them. Guards are a very nice alternative
for this.</p>
<p>Many times, the last guard is <code>otherwise</code>. <code>otherwise</code> is defined simply as
<code>otherwise = True</code> and catches everything. This is very similar to
patterns, only they check if the input satisfies a pattern but guards
check for boolean conditions. If all the guards of a function evaluate
to <code>False</code> (and we haven&apos;t provided an <code>otherwise</code> catch-all guard),
evaluation falls through to the next <em>pattern</em>. That&apos;s how patterns and
guards play nicely together. If no suitable guards or patterns are
found, an error is thrown.</p>
<p>Of course we can use guards with functions that take as many parameters
as we want. Instead of having the user calculate his own BMI before
calling the function, let&apos;s modify this function so that it takes a
height and weight and calculates it for us.</p>
<p>~~~~ {.haskell:hs name=&quot;code&quot;}
bmiTell :: (RealFloat a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; String
bmiTell weight height
    | weight / height ^ 2 &lt;= 18.5 = &quot;You&apos;re underweight, you emo, you!&quot;
    | weight / height ^ 2 &lt;= 25.0 = &quot;You&apos;re supposedly normal. Pffft, I bet you&apos;re ugly!&quot;
    | weight / height ^ 2 &lt;= 30.0 = &quot;You&apos;re fat! Lose some weight, fatty!&quot;
    | otherwise                 = &quot;You&apos;re a whale, congratulations!&quot;</p>
<pre><code>
Let&apos;s see if I&apos;m fat ...

~~~~ {.haskell:ghci name=&quot;code&quot;}

&quot;You&apos;re supposedly normal. Pffft, I bet you&apos;re ugly!&quot;
</code></pre><p>Yay! I&apos;m not fat! But Haskell just called me ugly. Whatever!</p>
<p>Note that there&apos;s no <code>=</code> right after the function name and its parameters,
before the first guard. Many newbies get syntax errors because they
sometimes put it there.</p>
<p>Another very simple example: let&apos;s implement our own <code>max</code> function. If
you remember, it takes two things that can be compared and returns the
larger of them.</p>
<p>~~~~ {.haskell:hs name=&quot;code&quot;}
max&apos; :: (Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
max&apos; a b
    | a &gt; b     = a
    | otherwise = b</p>
<pre><code>
Guards can also be written inline, although I&apos;d advise against that
because it&apos;s less readable, even for very short functions. But to
demonstrate, we could write `max&apos;` like this:

~~~~ {.haskell:hs name=&quot;code&quot;}
max&apos; :: (Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
max&apos; a b | a &gt; b = a | otherwise = b
</code></pre><p>Ugh! Not very readable at all! Moving on: let&apos;s implement our own

a <code>myCompare</code> b

    | otherwise = LT</p>
<pre><code>
~~~~ {.haskell:hs name=&quot;code&quot;}
ghci&gt; 3 `myCompare` 2
GT
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p><em>Note:</em> Not only can we call functions as infix with backticks, we can
also define them using backticks. Sometimes it&apos;s easier to read that
way.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="where">Where!?</h2>
<p>In the previous section, we defined a BMI calculator function and
berator like this:</p>
<p>~~~~ {.haskell:hs name=&quot;code&quot;}
bmiTell :: (RealFloat a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; String
bmiTell weight height
    | weight / height ^ 2 &lt;= 18.5 = &quot;You&apos;re underweight, you emo, you!&quot;
    | weight / height ^ 2 &lt;= 25.0 = &quot;You&apos;re supposedly normal. Pffft, I bet you&apos;re ugly!&quot;
    | weight / height ^ 2 &lt;= 30.0 = &quot;You&apos;re fat! Lose some weight, fatty!&quot;
    | otherwise                   = &quot;You&apos;re a whale, congratulations!&quot;</p>
<pre><code>
Notice that we repeat ourselves here three times. We repeat ourselves
three times. Repeating yourself (three times) while programming is about
as desirable as getting kicked inna head. Since we repeat the same
expression three times, it would be ideal if we could calculate it once,
bind it to a name and then use that name instead of the expression.
Well, we can modify our function like this:

~~~~ {.haskell:hs name=&quot;code&quot;}
bmiTell :: (RealFloat a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; String
bmiTell weight height
    | bmi &lt;= 18.5 = &quot;You&apos;re underweight, you emo, you!&quot;
    | bmi &lt;= 25.0 = &quot;You&apos;re supposedly normal. Pffft, I bet you&apos;re ugly!&quot;
    | bmi &lt;= 30.0 = &quot;You&apos;re fat! Lose some weight, fatty!&quot;
    | otherwise   = &quot;You&apos;re a whale, congratulations!&quot;
    where bmi = weight / height ^ 2
</code></pre><p>We put the keyword <code>where</code> after the guards (usually it&apos;s best to indent
it as much as the pipes are indented) and then we define several names
or functions. These names are visible across the guards and give us the
advantage of not having to repeat ourselves. If we decide that we want
to calculate BMI a bit differently, we only have to change it once. It
also improves readability by giving names to things and can make our
programs faster since stuff like our <code>bmi</code> variable here is calculated
only once. We could go a bit overboard and present our function like
this:</p>
<p>~~~~ {.haskell:hs name=&quot;code&quot;}
bmiTell :: (RealFloat a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; String
bmiTell weight height
    | bmi &lt;= skinny = &quot;You&apos;re underweight, you emo, you!&quot;
    | bmi &lt;= normal = &quot;You&apos;re supposedly normal. Pffft, I bet you&apos;re ugly!&quot;
    | bmi &lt;= fat    = &quot;You&apos;re fat! Lose some weight, fatty!&quot;
    | otherwise     = &quot;You&apos;re a whale, congratulations!&quot;
    where bmi = weight / height ^ 2
          skinny = 18.5
          normal = 25.0
          fat = 30.0</p>
<pre><code>
The names we define in the where section of a function are only visible
to that function, so we don&apos;t have to worry about them polluting the
namespace of other functions. Notice that all the names are aligned at a
single column. If we don&apos;t align them nice and proper, Haskell gets
confused because then it doesn&apos;t know they&apos;re all part of the same
block.

*where* bindings aren&apos;t shared across function bodies of different
patterns. If you want several patterns of one function to access some
shared name, you have to define it globally.

You can also use where bindings to *pattern match*! We could have
rewritten the where section of our previous function as:

~~~~ {.haskell:hs name=&quot;code&quot;}
    ...
    where bmi = weight / height ^ 2
          (skinny, normal, fat) = (18.5, 25.0, 30.0)
</code></pre><p>Let&apos;s make another fairly trivial function where we get a first and a
last name and give someone back their initials.</p>
<p>~~~~ {.haskell:hs name=&quot;code&quot;}
initials :: String -&gt; String -&gt; String
initials firstname lastname = [f] ++ &quot;. &quot; ++ [l] ++ &quot;.&quot;
    where (f:<em>) = firstname
          (l:</em>) = lastname</p>
<pre><code>
We could have done this pattern matching directly in the function&apos;s
parameters (it would have been shorter and clearer actually) but this
just goes to show that it&apos;s possible to do it in where bindings as well.

Just like we&apos;ve defined constants in where blocks, you can also define
functions. Staying true to our healthy programming theme, let&apos;s make a
function that takes a list of weight-height pairs and returns a list of
BMIs.

~~~~ {.haskell:hs name=&quot;code&quot;}
calcBmis :: (RealFloat a) =&gt; [(a, a)] -&gt; [a]
calcBmis xs = [bmi w h | (w, h) &lt;- xs]
    where bmi weight height = weight / height ^ 2
</code></pre><p>And that&apos;s all there is to it! The reason we had to introduce <code>bmi</code> as a
function in this example is because we can&apos;t just calculate one BMI from
the function&apos;s parameters. We have to examine the list passed to the
function and there&apos;s a different BMI for every pair in there.</p>
<p><em>where</em> bindings can also be nested. It&apos;s a common idiom to make a
function and define some helper function in its <em>where</em> clause and then
to give those functions helper functions as well, each with its own
<em>where</em> clause.</p>
<p><a name="let-it-be"></a></p>
<h2 id="let-it-be">Let it be</h2>
<p>Very similar to where bindings are let bindings. Where bindings are a
syntactic construct that let you bind to variables at the end of a
function and the whole function can see them, including all the guards.
Let bindings let you bind to variables anywhere and are expressions
themselves, but are very local, so they don&apos;t span across guards. Just
like any construct in Haskell that is used to bind values to names, let
bindings can be used for pattern matching. Let&apos;s see them in action!
This is how we could define a function that gives us a cylinder&apos;s
surface area based on its height and radius:</p>
<p>~~~~ {.haskell:hs name=&quot;code&quot;}
cylinder :: (RealFloat a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
cylinder r h =
    let sideArea = 2 <em> pi </em> r <em> h
        topArea = pi </em> r ^2
    in  sideArea + 2 * topArea</p>
<pre><code>
![let it be](img/letitbe.png)

The form is `let &lt;bindings&gt; in &lt;expression&gt;`. The names that you
define in the *let* part are accessible to the expression after the *in*
part. As you can see, we could have also defined this with a *where*
binding. Notice that the names are also aligned in a single column. So
what&apos;s the difference between the two? For now it just seems that *let*
puts the bindings first and the expression that uses them later whereas
*where* is the other way around.

The difference is that *let* bindings are expressions themselves.
*where* bindings are just syntactic constructs. Remember when we did the
if statement and it was explained that an if else statement is an
expression and you can cram it in almost anywhere?

~~~~ {.haskell:ghci name=&quot;code&quot;}

ghci&gt; 4 * (let a = 9 in a + 1) + 2

They can also be used to introduce functions in a local scope:

~~~~ {.haskell:ghci name=&quot;code&quot;}
ghci&gt; [let square x = x * x in (square 5, square 3, square 2)]
[(25,9,4)]
</code></pre><p>If we want to bind to several variables inline, we obviously can&apos;t align
them at columns. That&apos;s why we can separate them with semicolons.</p>
<p>~~~~ {.haskell:ghci name=&quot;code&quot;}
ghci&gt; (let a = 100; b = 200; c = 300 in a<em>b</em>c, let foo=&quot;Hey &quot;; bar = &quot;there!&quot; in foo ++ bar)
(6000000,&quot;Hey there!&quot;)</p>
<pre><code>
You don&apos;t have to put a semicolon after the last binding but you can if
you want. Like we said before, you can pattern match with *let*
bindings. They&apos;re very useful for quickly dismantling a tuple into
components and binding them to names and such.

~~~~ {.haskell:ghci name=&quot;code&quot;}
ghci&gt; (let (a,b,c) = (1,2,3) in a+b+c) * 100
600
</code></pre><p>You can also put <em>let</em> bindings inside list comprehensions. Let&apos;s
rewrite our previous example of calculating lists of weight-height pairs
to use a <em>let</em> inside a list comprehension instead of defining an

We include a *let* inside a list comprehension much like we would a
predicate, only it doesn&apos;t filter the list, it only binds to names. The
names defined in a *let* inside a list comprehension are visible to the
output function (the part before the |) and all predicates and sections
that come after of the binding. So we could make our function return
only the BMIs of fat people:

~~~~ {.haskell:hs name=&quot;code&quot;}
calcBmis :: (RealFloat a) =&gt; [(a, a)] -&gt; [a]
calcBmis xs = [bmi | (w, h) &lt;- xs, let bmi = w / h ^ 2, bmi &gt;= 25.0]
</code></pre><p>We can&apos;t use the <code>bmi</code> name in the <code>(w, h) &lt;- xs</code> part because it&apos;s defined
prior to the <em>let</em> binding.</p>
<p>We omitted the <em>in</em> part of the <em>let</em> binding when we used them in list
comprehensions because the visibility of the names is already predefined
there. However, we could use a <em>let in</em> binding in a predicate and the
names defined would only be visible to that predicate. The <em>in</em> part can
also be omitted when defining functions and constants directly in GHCi.
If we do that, then the names will be visible throughout the entire
interactive session.</p>

<pre><code>
If *let* bindings are so cool, why not use them all the time instead of
*where* bindings, you ask? Well, since *let* bindings are expressions
and are fairly local in their scope, they can&apos;t be used across guards.
Some people prefer *where* bindings because the names come after the
function they&apos;re being used in. That way, the function body is closer to
its name and type declaration and to some that&apos;s more readable.

Case expressions
----------------

![case](img/case.png)

Many imperative languages (C, C++, Java, etc.) have case syntax and if
you&apos;ve ever programmed in them, you probably know what it&apos;s about. It&apos;s
about taking a variable and then executing blocks of code for specific
values of that variable and then maybe including a catch-all block of
code in case the variable has some value for which we didn&apos;t set up a
case.

Haskell takes that concept and one-ups it. Like the name implies, case
expressions are, well, expressions, much like if else expressions and
*let* bindings. Not only can we evaluate expressions based on the
possible cases of the value of a variable, we can also do pattern
matching. Hmmm, taking a variable, pattern matching it, evaluating
pieces of code based on its value, where have we heard this before? Oh
yeah, pattern matching on parameters in function definitions! Well,
that&apos;s actually just syntactic sugar for case expressions. These two
pieces of code do the same thing and are interchangeable:

~~~~ {.haskell:hs name=&quot;code&quot;}
head&apos; :: [a] -&gt; a
head&apos; [] = error &quot;No head for empty lists!&quot;
head&apos; (x:_) = x
</code></pre><p>~~~~ {.haskell:hs name=&quot;code&quot;}
head&apos; :: [a] -&gt; a
head&apos; xs = case xs of [] -&gt; error &quot;No head for empty lists!&quot;
                      (x:_) -&gt; x</p>
<pre><code>
As you can see, the syntax for case expressions is pretty simple:

~~~~ {.haskell:hs name=&quot;code&quot;}
case expression of pattern -&gt; result
                   pattern -&gt; result
                   pattern -&gt; result
                   ...
</code></pre><p><code>expression</code> is matched against the patterns. The pattern matching action
is the same as expected: the first pattern that matches the expression
is used. If it falls through the whole case expression and no suitable
pattern is found, a runtime error occurs.</p>
<p>Whereas pattern matching on function parameters can only be done when
defining functions, case expressions can be used pretty much anywhere.
For instance:</p>
<p>~~~~ {.haskell:hs name=&quot;code&quot;}
describeList :: [a] -&gt; String
describeList xs = &quot;The list is &quot; ++ case xs of [] -&gt; &quot;empty.&quot;
                                               [x] -&gt; &quot;a singleton list.&quot;
                                               xs -&gt; &quot;a longer list.&quot;</p>

They are useful for pattern matching against something in the middle of
an expression. Because pattern matching in function definitions is
syntactic sugar for case expressions, we could have also defined this
like so:

~~~~ {.haskell:hs name=&quot;code&quot;}
describeList :: [a] -&gt; String
describeList xs = &quot;The list is &quot; ++ what xs
    where what [] = &quot;empty.&quot;
          what [x] = &quot;a singleton list.&quot;
          what xs = &quot;a longer list.&quot;
</code></pre>
                                
                                </section>
